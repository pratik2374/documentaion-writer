## get_session_history
```python
def get_session_history(session_id: str) -> list:
    """Retrieves the history of events for a given session.

    This function fetches and returns a list of events that occurred
    during a specific user session.

    Args:
        session_id (str): A unique identifier for the user session.

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents
              an event in the session. Each event dictionary will include
              at least the following keys:
                - 'event_type': (str) The type of event (e.g., 'page_view', 'purchase', 'search').
                - 'timestamp': (datetime) The time when the event occurred.
                - 'data': (dict) Additional data associated with the event.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the provided session_id is invalid or not found.

    Example:
        >>> get_session_history('session123')
        [
            {'event_type': 'page_view', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 26, 10, 30, 0), 'data': {'page_url': 'https://www.example.com/product_details'}},
            {'event_type': 'search', 'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 26, 10, 35, 0), 'data': {'query': 'running shoes'}}
        ]

    pass
```

**Explanation:**

* **Purpose:** The function's primary goal is to retrieve a historical record of events associated with a particular user session.
* **Parameters:**
    * `session_id`: This parameter is a mandatory string representing a unique identifier for the session.
* **Returns:** The function returns a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary within the list represents a single event within the session. Each event dictionary will have at least the following keys:
    * `event_type`:  A string describing the nature of the event (e.g., 'page_view', 'purchase', 'search').
    * `timestamp`: A datetime object indicating the exact time when the event occurred.
    * `data`: A dictionary containing additional context-specific information about the event.
* **Raises:** If the provided `session_id` is invalid or cannot be found in the system, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
* **Example:** The docstring provides a clear example of how the function might be used and what the expected output structure looks like.

## generate_response
```python
def generate_response(question, llm):
  """
  Generates a response to a given question using a large language model (LLM).

  Args:
    question: A string representing the user's question.

    llm: An instance of a large language model, capable of understanding and generating text.
        This could be an object from a library like OpenAI's GPT-3,
        HuggingFace Transformers, or any other suitable LLM framework.

  Returns:
    A string containing the LLM's generated response to the question.

  Purpose:

    This function acts as a bridge between a user's question and the capabilities
    of a large language model. It takes a natural language question and passes
    it to the provided LLM for processing. The LLM then uses its knowledge and
    understanding of language to generate a coherent and relevant response.

  Example:

    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI

    # Initialize an OpenAI API client
    openai = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")

    # Define a function to generate a response using GPT-3
    def generate_response(question, llm):
      return llm.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=question,
        max_tokens=150  # Control the length of the response
      ).choices[0].text.strip()

    # Example usage
    user_question = "What is the capital of France?"
    response = generate_response(user_question, openai)
    print(response)  # Output: Paris
    ```

  Notes:

    - The choice of LLM and its configuration (e.g., model size, temperature)
      can significantly impact the quality and style of the generated response.

    - Ensure you have the necessary libraries and API keys set up to interact
      with the chosen LLM.

  # Code to interact with the LLM and generate a response
  # ...
```



**Explanation:**

* **Purpose:** The docstring clearly states the function's goal: to generate a response to a question using a provided large language model.
* **Arguments:**
    * `question`:  The user's question as a string.
    * `llm`: An instance of a language model capable of understanding and generating text.
* **Returns:** A string containing the LLM's generated response.
* **Example:**  A practical example demonstrates how to use the function with OpenAI's GPT-3, providing context on API keys and response length.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** You might want to include error handling in the function to gracefully handle cases where the LLM fails to generate a response or encounters unexpected inputs.
* **Customization:**  The docstring could mention potential ways to customize the response, such as adjusting the LLM's parameters or providing additional context.
* **Limitations:** It's important to be transparent about the limitations of the LLM, such as its potential biases, inability to access real-time information, or limitations in understanding complex or nuanced questions.

## response_generator
```python
def response_generator(prompt, llm):
    """
    Generates a response to a given prompt using a specified large language model (LLM).

    Args:
        prompt (str): The input prompt to be answered by the LLM. This can be a question, a statement,
                      or any other text that the user wants the LLM to respond to.

        llm (LLM object): An instance of a large language model (e.g., GPT-3, Jurassic-1 Jumbo)
                          that has a `generate_text` method. This method should take the prompt as
                          input and return the LLM's generated response as text.

    Returns:
        str: The text response generated by the LLM in response to the given prompt.

    Example:
        >>> from my_llm_client import Jurassic1Jumbo  # Example LLM client
        >>> my_llm = Jurassic1Jumbo()  # Initialize an instance of the LLM
        >>> response = response_generator("What is the capital of France?", my_llm)
        >>> print(response)  # Output: Paris

    Purpose:
        This function provides a simple and reusable interface for interacting with different LLMs. 
        It abstracts away the specifics of each LLM's API and allows you to use the same function 
        regardless of the underlying LLM implementation.

        It allows for easy swapping of LLMs by simply changing the `llm` parameter.
        This promotes modularity and flexibility in your applications.

    """
    return llm.generate_text(prompt)
```

**Explanation:**

* **Purpose:** The `response_generator` function serves as a generic interface for generating responses from various large language models (LLMs). 
* **Parameters:**
    * `prompt` (str): The text input that the user wants the LLM to understand and respond to.
    * `llm` (LLM object): An object representing a specific LLM, such as GPT-3 or Jurassic-1 Jumbo. This object must have a `generate_text` method that takes the prompt as input and returns the LLM's generated response.
* **Returns:**  A string containing the text response generated by the LLM.
* **Example:** The docstring includes a simple example demonstrating how to use the function. It assumes you have a hypothetical `Jurassic1Jumbo` LLM client and initializes an instance of it. Then, it calls `response_generator` with a prompt and prints the resulting response.

**Key Points:**

* **Abstraction:** The function hides the complexity of interacting with different LLMs by providing a consistent interface.
* **Modularity:** You can easily swap out one LLM for another by simply changing the `llm` parameter, making your code more flexible.
* **Extensibility:** You can add support for new LLMs by creating new LLM object types that implement the required `generate_text` method.
